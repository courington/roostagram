# Roostagram!

## What it is

Roostagram was created by engineers at Bocoup to demonstrate and teach the software development process using modern tools and workflows. This application is collaboratively built during [Roost](http://roost.bocoup.com) and [Bocoup's training classes](http://training.bocoup.com/classes). For a complete list of the tools Roostagram uses, [check out this gist](https://gist.github.com/bobholt/8922767). 

## Installation

Make sure you have all this stuff.

1. Install [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/). Make sure you install something on the
v.0.10 release branch. Version 0.11 is a development branch and breaks some of
the libraries in our application.
2. Install [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) globally by typing `npm install -g
grunt-cli` into your terminal/command line.
3. Install [Bower](http://bower.io/) globally by typing `npm install -g bower`.
4. Install [git](http://git-scm.com/downloads).

_Note: If npm shows errors (which happens from time to time) re-try the command.
If npm needs administrator access, use `sudo` (Mac, linux) or run your command
shell as Administrator (Windows)._

Once you have all of these, you can download this repo, `cd` into this
directory, run `npm install` to install all of the dependencies, and `grunt` to
start the tasks to run the server and see the site.
